## How did we approach the problem

Our initial idea was to train a local model with the data supplied by Uber, however due to the lack of labels 
we wanted to generate some ourselves using the few-shot approach. However since this was too resource intensive we 
did not continue down that route. 

In the end we just trained our model on some predefined situations in order to make it more personalized and 
fit for this scenario.
